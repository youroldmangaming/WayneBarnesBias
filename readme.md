# Overall Analysis of Referee Performance and Bias Against Wayne Barnes

## Key Components of the Analysis

1. **Loading Cleaned Data**: The analysis begins by loading the cleaned CSV files containing match statistics for Wayne Barnes and other referees.

2. **Win/Loss Calculation**: The script calculates the number of wins, losses, and draws for both Wayne Barnes and other referees. For Barnes, the statistics show:
   - Wins: **16**
   - Losses: **9**
   - Draws: **0**
   - Total Matches: **25**
   - Win Ratio: **64%**

   In contrast, other referees have the following statistics:
   - Wins: **264**
   - Losses: **51**
   - Draws: **7**
   - Total Matches: **322**
   - Win Ratio: **82%**

3. **Win Ratio Calculation**: The win ratios highlight a significant difference between Barnes and his peers. Barnes's win ratio of **64%** is notably lower than the average win ratio of **82%** for other referees.

4. **Statistical Test**: A Chi-squared test is performed to assess whether the differences in outcomes are statistically significant. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) would indicate that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to random chance, suggesting a potential bias against Barnes when officiating.

5. **Visualization**: The results are visualized using bar charts, allowing for easy comparison of win/loss outcomes between Barnes and other referees.

## Analysis of the Data

- **Win Ratios**: 
  - Nigel Owens has the highest win percentage at **85%**, winning **22 out of 26** matches.
  - Wayne Barnes, with a win percentage of **64%**, ranks significantly lower than his peers, indicating that he has a less favorable outcome in terms of wins compared to other referees.

- **Comparison with Other Referees**:
  - Barnes's win percentage (64%) is lower than all other referees listed, suggesting that he may be less effective in terms of match outcomes when compared to his peers.
  - The average win percentage for the referees listed (excluding Barnes) is approximately **82.2%**.

- **Games Officiated**:
  - Barnes has officiated **25 games**, which is a reasonable sample size for analysis. However, it is still lower than some of the other referees like Owens (26 games) and Joubert (19 games).

- **Losses and Draws**:
  - Barnes has **9 losses** and no draws, indicating that the matches he officiated were often decisive. In contrast, Joubert has only **1 loss** and **1 draw**, suggesting a more favorable performance in terms of match outcomes.

- **Duration of Officiating**:
  - The duration of officiating for each referee varies. For example, Nigel Owens officiated from **21st Jul 2007 to 26th Oct 2019**, while Barnes has been officiating since **8th Sep 2007** and continues to the present.

## Conclusion

The data indicates that Wayne Barnes has a lower win percentage compared to other referees, particularly Nigel Owens and Craig Joubert. This discrepancy could suggest a bias against Barnes when officiating matches involving the All Blacks. The statistical analysis, including the Chi-squared test, further supports the notion that the differences in outcomes are unlikely to be due to random chance.

Further investigation, including a deeper analysis of specific match circumstances and contexts, could provide additional insights into these findings and Barnes motivation.
